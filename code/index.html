<!--
To-Do List: (mostly in order)
IDEAS
- figure out what the remaining cards do
  - ice castle
  - underwater ruin
  - tempest ward (maybe change the name because the image is more of a shield)
  - support chinook
  - healing spring
  - reflourish
  - ancient temple

ALSO FOR ART MAKE:
- symbols in the middle of the selection screen things (to put beside the player to show which element they chose)
- popup boxes (all 4, 3 errors, confirm end turn if did nothing)
- draw and discard guis (maybe they are also called popups?)

VISUALS
- drawing the selection screen
- add event listener for clicks and mouse movements
- gamestate: selection
- make it so that you can actually select a deck

- drawing the actual game
- drawing the placed cards and hand cards
  - MAYBE: make something to show how much mana a card costs without having to read the hover description
- drawing player, mana, and enemy text
- gamestate: playing
- add event listener for using cards and checking discard pile
- make the mana bar change
- end turn button
- enemy ai (shouldn't be too hard)
- drawing cards into your hand
- gaining # mana per turn (haven't decided, probably like 2 or 3 or something)
- hovering over the deck makes the background slightly lighter
- hovering over hand cards descriptions
- hovering over tower cards descriptions
- hovering over deck cards descriptions

- pop ups when you can't use a card or whatever
- gamestate: popup
- possibly confirm popups whenever you use a card (if not this, then make one for when you are ending your turn without doing anything)

- animations for whenver a tower gets damaged, dies, gets more defense, or gets healed
- gamestate: animation

PROGESSION
- add two more enemies before you get to the final boss
  - you need lots of ideas to do this
- make it so whenever you defeat an enemy your deck gets upgraded (more cards and better cards)

SOUND DESIGN
- possibly add sound effects for whenever a tower dies, gets damaged, gets more defense, or gets healed
- even bigger maybe: add sound effects for whenever you use a card
  - even even bigger maybe: special sound effects depending on the card

LORE
- text/dialogue when the boss dies
- end screen
- play again button

<!--
Things I need to add: (sidebar because i use 1/4, 3/4 html js view)
- actual canvas rendering (framerate and constant drawing)
- card drawing system
- visuals for sprites
  - hovering over cards and towers for descriptions
  - hovering over draw and discard pile to see the cards
- the difference between magic and physical damage
- card usage and other click detection things
- selecting lanes
- card usage
- before-game element selection
- between-game reset
- popups when using cards
  - check retry function for errors
  - confirmation
- card use popup or whatever saying "<enemy name> used fireball!"
- the ai smh

even more possible ideas:
- animations
  - effect/usage animations (red flash for damage, etc.)
  - fly in as well as fade in animations going in and out of game
- sound design when using or selecting things
