<!--
To-Do List: (mostly in order)

VISUALS
PROGESSION
- add two more enemies before you get to the final boss
  - you need lots of ideas to do this
- make it so whenever you defeat an enemy your deck gets upgraded (more cards and better cards)

SOUND DESIGN
- possibly add sound effects for whenever a tower dies, gets damaged, gets more defense, or gets healed
- even bigger maybe: add sound effects for whenever you use a card
  - even even bigger maybe: special sound effects depending on the card

LORE
- text/dialogue when the boss dies
- end screen
- play again button

<!--
Things I need to add: (sidebar because i use 1/4, 3/4 html js view)
- actual canvas rendering (framerate and constant drawing)
- card drawing system
- visuals for sprites
  - hovering over cards and towers for descriptions
  - hovering over draw and discard pile to see the cards
- the difference between magic and physical damage
- card usage and other click detection things
- selecting lanes
- card usage
- before-game element selection
- between-game reset
- popups when using cards
  - check retry function for errors
  - confirmation
- card use popup or whatever saying "<enemy name> used fireball!"
- the ai smh

even more possible ideas:
- animations
  - effect/usage animations (red flash for damage, etc.)
  - fly in as well as fade in animations going in and out of game
- sound design when using or selecting things
